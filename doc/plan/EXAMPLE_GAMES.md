### Game 1: The Dungeon of Doom
- Description:
  - "The Dungeon of Doom" is a puzzle game set in a dungeon environment. 
  - Players must navigate through a maze of walls and obstacles to reach a goal, represented by a specific block type in the game's grid.
- Functional Commonalities:
  - Grid-based environment.
  - The use of specific symbols (numbers in this case) to represent different entities or terrain types (e.g., '1' for walls, '2' for the player, '3' for an objective or special item).
  - Metadata providing contextual information about the game level (difficulty, author, language).
- Functional Differences:
  - The game is will have a straightforward, player-versus-environment puzzle mechanic without advanced AI or special modes.
  - The graphical representation uses basic images to represent the player, walls, and objectives.
  - The "special-mode" is set to "Normal," suggesting standard gameplay without additional computational or player behavior complexities.

### Game 2: The Caverns of Insight
- Description:
  - "The Caverns of Insight" introduces an Artificial Intelligence special mode, meaning there are now AI-controlled opponents. 
  - This game's setting is more complex, with additional grid rows and columns, offering a different strategic experience.
- Functional Commonalities:
  - Maintains a grid-based layout for gameplay.
  - Utilizes symbolic representation for game elements within the grid.
  - Includes metadata for contextual understanding.
- Functional Differences:
  - The introduction of an "ArtificialIntelligence" special mode suggests dynamic responses to player actions, requiring different strategies or approaches.
  - The game includes a "Lava" element,  introducing hazard mechanics that can affect player movement or success.
  - The graphic assets are themed differently (e.g., steel walls and lava), creating a different aesthetic experience.
