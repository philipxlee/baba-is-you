### Project Goals
* Develop a full implementation of the base game "Baba Is You"
* Develop variations of "Baba Is You" and create an authoring environment that enables different variations
* Each person enjoys the section of code assigned to them and enjoys the project/game as a whole
* Milestones are made in increments, and people communicate adequately about the progress they make for
each milestone and any difficulties they encounter

### Project Emphasis
* Because of the complexity of the game and the interactions between the authoring environment and the game player, we believe our backend will be more important than our frontend. Also, more people on the team prefer working on backend than frontend. For these reasons, we plan to place an emphasis on the backend of our application. This includes our data models, API endpoints and the general data flow from user input to functional output.  


### Project Extensions
* Basic
  * Dynamic Game Rules: Given the way Baba Is You is played, we inherently have to make this extension
  within our game.
  * Help System: Ideally we would like to configure each of our levels through XML config files, and adding
  things like hints and tutorials would be easy to add to these config files.
  * AI Players: Build enemy players who would chase Baba and decrease Baba's health, leading to the user losing the game.
  For instance, we would need consistent heuristics like the Manhattan Distance that allows enemy players to chase Baba.
* Challenging
  * Social center: Let different users of Baba Is You come together in a social center to chat, rate, comment on games etc.


### Sprint Progress Goals
* These would mark good progress for each sprint:
  * An outline of which tasks we've finished
  * An outline of which tasks we're planning to complete
  * Removing any blockers that people run into
  * Ensure people that are working on overlapping parts of the project agree on changes they make
