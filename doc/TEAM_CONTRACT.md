### Helping each other
 * best ways to and when to ask for help
   * Reach out to the team early to see if anyone has availability. Vocalize in team meetings
   or reach out through text if a problem comes up.
 * responses to team member asking for help
   * Have some members offer help or the whole team if necessary
   * Be accepting and encouraging of others
   * Work collectively as a team
 * how to support the team priorities
   * Constantly check in with each other and align your work with the parts you are delegated
     * If you are encountering obstacles with the parts you are delegated, vocalize these issues and
     ask for help or a change in responsibilities.
 * how to suggest design changes for specific pieces of code
   * Be unafraid to vocalize your opinions
     * Depending on what section of code this involves, be sure to tell all people involved about the
     idea before implementing it. If it will only impact the code you are assigned to, you probably don't
     have to vocalize that and you can just implement it. If it will impact the backend, tell people assigned
     to the backend. If it impacts the whole project, tell all of your teammates
   * Alternatively, push these design changes to your individual branch and have your teammates check 
   the changes before approving a merge

## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these agreements, the team may:
 * Have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
 * Report the issue in the Team Sprint Report
 * Set up meetings to help the person plan better and understand the areas they are struggling with
